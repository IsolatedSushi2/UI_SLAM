Fix the rangeslider (the block movement doesnt feel nice)
    - Can use the other one, but it was bugged (already asked question) https://github.com/napari/superqt

Fix the rotation, rotate around center of mask
    - Already asked question in the gitter

Figure out how to handle camera rotation along the direction vector (do quaternions handle this?)

Add rangesliders for the other views (pointcloud and camera)

Add visualisation for the keyframe etc

Add the directory upload

Extract the fundamental matrix

Extract camera pose

Tool for comparing the camera movements

Create point cloud with the camera movement
    - Can do some corrections
        - Dont use 2 frames, but more with the same keypoint to get better results
            - Will have to lookup some more information

try out some other datasets (All have to be the TUM format)

Incorperate the evaluation tool that the TUM dataset provided 
    - Can make some cool charts

Make good video to showcase the tool

We can drop the images themselves to save memory after extracting the data
    - Would have change up some work, since it is sequential atm
    - That system would allow multithreading as well I guess (No GIL issues since it is IO bound at some cases)

Could haves:
The depth map corrections (some papers about that subject)

extreme ideas:
Write in c++ for learning, and big performance gain
